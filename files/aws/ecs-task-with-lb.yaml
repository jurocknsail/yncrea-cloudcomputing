Parameters:
  StackName:
    Type: String

    Default: hellomicro
    Description: A name for the service
  ImageUrl:
    Type: String
    Description: The url of a docker image that contains the application process that
      will handle the traffic for this service
  ContainerPort:
    Type: Number
    Default: 8080
    Description: What port number the application inside the docker container is binding to
  ContainerCpu:
    Type: Number
    Default: 256
    Description: How much CPU to give the container. 1024 is 1 CPU

  Path:
    Type: String
    Default: "*"
    Description: A path on the public load balancer that this service

      traffic to this service.
  Priority:
    Type: Number
    Default: 1
    Description: The priority for the routing rule added to the load balancer.
      This only applies if your have multiple services which have been
      assigned to different paths on the load balancer.
  DesiredCount:
    Type: Number
    Default: 1
    Description: How many copies of the service task to run
  Role:
    Type: String
    Default: ""
    Description: (Optional) An IAM role to give the service's containers if the code within needs to
      access other AWS resources like S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, etc
