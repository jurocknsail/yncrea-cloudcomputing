# Getting started with Github (1 hour)

The goal of this exercise is to upload your current progress into a version control system.

For this course, we are using Github.com as a our platform. Within the next one hour, please perform the following steps:

1. Sign Up to Github.com
1. Install git on your workstation
1. Create a new repository with the name "ssc". It will serve as the base for the following days and all changes will be stored here
1. Follow the instructions on how to add existing source code into your newly created repository. Perform the indicated steps in the previously created "CloudAwarenessLab" folder on your workstation
1. Push your source code into your repository

Once this is done, you can take the remaining time and get familiar with the Gitflow best practice [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

Ideally, for future labs you will create a new branch for exery exercise and merge it to the Git master through a "Pull Request".
