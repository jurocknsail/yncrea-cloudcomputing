# EKS Setup

You have already experimented with a local Kubernetes installation in the form of Minikube.
In the next step, we will set up a managed Kubernetes on AWS.
For this, we will use EKS, the Elastic Kubernetes Service.

To facilitate the instantiation of Kubernetes, we will use eksctl, a command line tool interact with Kubernetes.
To install it, please follow the guidelines [here](https://eksctl.io/introduction/installation/).
